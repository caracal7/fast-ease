                    <p class="answer">
                        <b>i.js</b>¬†is a future-proof micro library for building modern user interfaces. It can be easily used for building SEO-friendly regular websites but is more focused on building extremely big Single-Page Applications. You can use it with any popular framework like React, Vue or JQuery but after you taste the true power of¬†<b>i.js</b>¬†you would not need anything else.¬†
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> What about browser support?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">
                        It is based on native¬†<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web-Components spec</a>¬†without any hacks and magic and works in any modern browser including mobile ones or SmartTVs.
                        However it has not been tested widely, use at your own risk.
                        Internet Explorer support is yet to be added but it may still run.
                        Or may not :)
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> How fast is it?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">
                        <b>i.js</b> is based on one of the fastest virtual DOM implementations over the native¬†<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/customElements">customElements</a>. <b>i.js</b> designed with performance in mind.
                        It could be even faster but our goal was to keep balance between the speed of DOM/state manipulations and the speed of development with syntax sugar.
                        Considering the power of modern PCs and smartphones the latter is a way more important task.
                        Anyway <b>i.js</b> is faster then most of UI frameworks on the marketü§ò
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="question" ><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Can I use it in production right now?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">
                        <b>No</b>. Noway. But <b>yes</b> if you know what you are doing. ü§ì You can still use it for prototyping of your great ideas‚òùÔ∏è.
                    </p>

                        <li>no community at all</li>
                        <li>you need to follow a diet (like be careful in synthax, etc) to avoid issues</li>
                        <li>no support for old browsers</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        We use this development concept in production since late 2020 in a closed environment in a group of companies.
                        It includes realtime ERP for several production factories, realtime CRM for a trading company as well as a number of small applications like industrial robots control panelü§ñ and so on.
                        In closed environments like these we may not really care about browsers as a certain one can be used across all companies, reaction for any change request is fast, etc.
                        At the moment we are not ready to maintain it and provide support outisde our companies.
